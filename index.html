    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Moeca Takeshima. I am 29 years old and from Japan. I moved to the U.S. 
        last December and attended a college in San Diego for the Spring 2024 semester. 
        This is my first semester at ECC, and I am currently working towards a CIS certificate. 
        After earning the certificate, I plan to apply for jobs related to it. 
        I have six years of work experience in Japan, including roles as a police officer, tour guide, and research assistant. 
        I have a husband who works in the IT field, and we plan to start our own IT company with friends in the future.</p>
